excerpt: >-
  The iterative solution of the coupled cluster equations exhibits a synergistic relationship
  among the various cluster amplitudes. The iteration scheme is analyzed as a multivariate
  discrete time propagation of nonlinearly coupled equations, which is dictated by only a few
  principal cluster amplitudes. These principal amplitudes usually correspond to only a few
  valence excitations, whereas all other cluster amplitudes are enslaved and behave as auxiliary
  variables [Agarawal et al., J. Chem. Phys. 154, 044110 (2021)]. We develop a coupled cluster–
  machine learning hybrid scheme where various supervised machine learning strategies are
  introduced to establish the interdependence between the principal and auxiliary amplitudes
  on-the-fly. While the coupled cluster equations are solved only to determine the principal
  amplitudes, the auxiliary amplitudes, on the other hand, are determined via regression as
  unique functionals of the principal amplitudes. This leads to significant reduction in the
  number of independent degrees of freedom during the iterative optimization, which saves
  significant computation time. A few different regression techniques have been developed,
  which have their own advantages and disadvantages. The scheme has been applied to several
  molecules in their equilibrium and stretched geometries, and our scheme, with all the
  regression models, shows a significant reduction in computation time over the canonical
  coupled cluster calculations without unduly sacrificing the accuracy.
