excerpt: >-
  Per-and polyfluorinated substances (PFAS) are synthetic compounds used in the
  production of fluoropolymer coatings found in products such as non-stick pans,
  clothing, cosmetics, and food packaging. These highly persistent molecules are
  known as “forever chemicals” since they neither degrade environmentally nor break
  down enzymatically within biological systems. PFAS compounds readily contaminate
  water sources, and as a result, certain PFAS molecules have bioaccumulated in exposed
  species including humans. The purpose of this study was to define the effect of two
  PFAS molecules, the ostensibly more toxic perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and the more
  recent, reportedly safer chemical hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (Gen X), on the
  development of Lytechinus variegatus sea urchin embryos. We examined the effects of PFOA
  and Gen X on development and patterning using morphological analysis, immunostaining,
  HCR-FISH, and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The results show that both PFAS compounds
  are teratogenic to sea urchin embryos. PFOA and Gen X each function at different intervals
  during development and provoke distinct phenotypic and gene expression outcomes. Despite
  beliefs that Gen X would be a safer alternative, our findings indicate that Gen X has earlier
  and more severe effects on endomesoderm and dorsal-ventral axis specification, neural
  development and function, and pattern formation compared to PFOA. These results illustrate
  the dangerous teratogenic potential of environmentally accumulating PFAS like Gen X,
  underscoring the negative ecological implications that accompany continuing commercial
  and industrial use of PFAS in the absence of remediation strategies.
