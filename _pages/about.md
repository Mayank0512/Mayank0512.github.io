I am a Bioinformatician in the laboratory of Dr. Paola Arlotta at the Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology at Harvard and an Associate at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard .

I completed my Masters in Bioinformatics at the Boston University. During my masters, I worked with Prof. Cynthia Bradham, and Dr. Dakota Hawkins, and largely focussed on Elucidating the temporal, spatial, and mechanistic underpinnings of PMC diversiﬁcation. The project was an extension of the work done by Dr. Dakota Hawkins for his PhD thesis under Prof. Bradham and I used the pipelines developed by him.

I am deeply interested in analyzing data from multi-omic single-cell spatially resolved technologies. I am particularly intrigued by the questions, “How does the brain learn?” and “How does an embryo develop into an adult?” I aspire to apply these innovative technologies to uncover insights that could help answer these fundamental questions about biological processes. Ultimately, this research could lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying complex diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), paving the way for the development of effective treatments.
